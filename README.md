# Quantum Mechanical Atomic Model Visualization

This project provides an interactive 3D visualization of the quantum mechanical atomic model. It accurately depicts electron probability density clouds, s/p/d/f orbital shapes, and the Aufbau filling order based on quantum numbers.

## Features

- **Interactive 3D View:** Rotate, pan, and zoom to explore the atomic structure.
- **Scientifically Accurate:** Visualizes probability density functions for hydrogen-like orbitals.
- **Element Selector:** Choose elements from Hydrogen (Z=1) to Krypton (Z=36).
- **Configuration Display:** Shows the electron configuration (e.g., 1s² 2s² 2p²).
- **Customizable Controls:** Adjust cloud density, animation speed, nucleus size, and more.
- **Orbital Visualization:** Highlight specific subshells (s, p, d, f) or view individual orbitals.
- **Energy Level Diagram:** Visual representation of orbital energies and electron filling.

## Usage

### Viewing the Simulation

The simulation is deployed to GitHub Pages and can be accessed directly in your browser.
[Link to your GitHub Pages site will be here once deployed]

### Running Locally

To run the simulation locally:

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Navigate to the project directory.
3.  Start a local HTTP server. For example, using Python:

    ```bash
    python3 -m http.server 8080
    ```

4.  Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8080`.
